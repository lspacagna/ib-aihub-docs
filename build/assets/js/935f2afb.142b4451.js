These networks learn from a broad range of data, rather than being programmed explicitly. People use language and images to describe the world and to express their beliefs, assumptions, attitudes, and values. As a result, publicly available text and image data typically used to train large-scale natural language processing models contain societal biases relating to race, gender, religion, age, and other groups of people, as well as other undesirable content.
