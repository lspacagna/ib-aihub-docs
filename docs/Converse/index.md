​Upload a document to create a new conversation. After it's uploaded, you can ask Converse questions about your document to get clear, concise information about it.​

For example, for a payroll statement, you might ask questions like:​

- How much did I pay for insurance?
- How much did I contribute to my 401k?
- How much did I pay in taxes?​
- Converse saves your conversations so you can return to them later.​

Converse uses a default model that's good at quickly analyzing most documents. If you are processing more complex documents such as images or complicated instructions you might want to try the advanced model, which is better at handling images and complex tasks that involve reasoning. The advanced model provides more accurate and detailed results, but it is slower and more costly than the default model. Select the model in the drop-down menu in the chat box.​

## How to ask Converse great questions

AI models give better answers when you ask better questions. These tips can help you to get the most out of Converse.​

**Provide direction:** Be explicit about the format you want the answer in or how you want the model to think about the problem. For instance, if you want a summary of a document, specify the desired length or key points to focus on. This helps to guide Converse's response to better align with your expectations.​

**Think step-by-step:** When asking Converse to perform complex tasks in one prompt, ask it to explain its response step-by-step. This allows the model to focus on each task individually, improving the accuracy of each response and overall output. For questions that require more reasoning, try Converse's Advanced model, which provides slower, but higher quality, results.​

**Provide context:** Help Converse with more context about why you are using it; this helps it better understand what you need. For instance, if you want it to help you understand a balance sheet, you could tell it that you are an investment banker evaluating a company as a potential investment or that you are a college student trying to solve a finance class assignment.​

**Include examples:** When you ask questions, provide an example to specify your desired output. For instance, if you want to fetch all the Amazon product links from a document, instead of asking Converse to fetch all the Amazon product links, you could ask something like: "fetch all the Amazon product links from this document; here's an example of what an Amazon product link looks like: 
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B7NPRY8"
​
**Request output as tables or JSON:** If you're dealing with data extraction or structured information, you can ask Converse to return the output as a table or as JSON. This can make the extracted data easier to understand, manipulate, and integrate into other systems or applications.​

**Practice and learn:** The more you interact with Converse, the better you'll understand its strengths and weaknesses. Keep experimenting with different ways of phrasing questions to get the most out of its capabilities.​

## Some limitations to keep in mind

**​Chat History:** Converse has no memory of the questions that you've already asked. It's crucial that your question includes any relevant information from previous questions.​

**Long documents:** Converse can process and answer questions about very long documents. To do this, Converse breaks down the document in chunks and uses the most relevant chunks to answer your question. Sometimes, Converse may select the wrong chunks, or the data you're requesting may be spread over more chunks than Converse considers. Be mindful of this--the page numbers in Converse's answers tell you which pages Converse is using to answer your questions.​

**Hallucination:** Sometimes, AI models like Converse may "hallucinate" details that aren't present in the original context or content. This usually happens when the model is asked to infer or speculate. To avoid this, ask clear and specific questions. Each answer that Converse provides includes the page numbers Converse uses to get the answer. Click on these page numbers to verify that the data Converse is using is correct, and use your own knowledge about the document to double-check the answers Converse provides.​

**Biases:** Converse is trained on a large dataset, and therefore, it may unintentionally reflect biases present in this data. These are more likely to show when the model is asked to infer or speculate. Be aware of these potential biases when interpreting responses, especially those pertaining to sensitive subjects.
