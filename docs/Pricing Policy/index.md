# Pricing Policy

**1. Introduction**

This Pricing Policy (**“Policy”**) sets forth the terms and conditions under which you may subscribe to the use of the AI Hub platform by purchasing consumption units (**“Consumption Units”** or **“Units”**). By purchasing and using these Consumption Units, you agree to be bound by this Policy and the AI Hub [Terms of Use](https://instabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230527_AI-Hub_Professional-Terms-of-Use.pdf).


**2. Purchase and Value of Consumption Units**

You may purchase 100 Consumption Units per U.S. dollar, in increments of 100 Units.


**3. Usage of Consumption Units**

You may choose from available model options and utilize Consumption Units for specific services/apps available on AI Hub as follows: 

**CONVERSE**

| # of Pages         | Default Model    | Advanced Model    |

If you chose the **Advanced Model** in the **CONVERSE** app:

**BUILD**

| # of Pages         | Default Model    |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 1 Page             | 1 Unit/field   |
| Up to 5 Pages      | 3 Units/field  |
| Up to 10 Pages     | 5 Units/field  |
| Up to 100 Pages    | 7 Units/field  |
| Up to 1000 Pages   | 9 Units/field  |
| 1000+ Pages        | 10 Units/field |

For example, if you chose the **Default Model** in the **BUILD** app:

- For a 2-Page pay stub, you will be charged 3 Units/field for extracting fields such as net pay, pay period, employee name, etc.
- For an 8-Page letter of credit, you will be charged 5 Units/field for extracting fields such as description of goods, port of loading, etc.

**BATCH RUN**

| # of Pages         | Default Model      |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1 Page             | 0.8 Unit/field   |
| Up to 5 Pages      | 2.4 Units/field  |
| Up to 10 Pages     | 4 Units/field    |
| Up to 100 Pages    | 5.6 Units/field  |
| Up to 1000 Pages   | 7.2 Units/field  |
| 1000+ Pages        | 8 Units/field    |


**4. Page Definition**

- For documents that support pages (PDF, Word, PPT, TIFF images, etc.), each page in the document counts as 1 Page.
- For images (png, jpeg, bmp, etc.), each image counts as 1 Page; multiple images embedded on a single page count as 1 Page.
- For email files where there is no native concept of a "page", Instabase uses **“Logical Page Count”**. This means that emails with up to 10,000 characters (including white spaces) will count as 1 Page. If an email contains an attachment (e.g., a PDF with 100 pages), each page of the attachment counts as a separate Page. If an email is multi-threaded (e.g., 20 replies to a single email chain), Instabase will only count the highest total number in the chain as total Pages processed.
- For Excel files where there is no native concept of a “page”, Supplier uses Logical Page Count. This means that Excel files with up to 1,000 cells (including white spaces) will count as 1 Page. If an Excel file contains multiple tabs, each tab containing data of the Excel sheet counts in determining the number of Pages. For each tab within an Excel file with data, Supplier will only consider the area defined by the upper most left-hand cell containing data and the lower most right-hand cell containing data (including white spaces contained therein) when determining the number of Pages.

**5. Consumption Unit Details**

Consumption Units provide a convenient way to track the amount of AI Hub Services you have purchased and consumed under the AI Hub Pricing Policy. All purchases of Consumption Units are final and non-refundable. Consumption Units are non-transferable and can be used only by the customer that purchased them for the use of AI Hub apps, including Converse, Build, and other prebuilt apps that will be released over time.  The Units are of no direct monetary value and cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents.  Subject to your compliance with the Pricing Policy, you subscribe to the amount of AI Hub usage you purchase as Consumption Units for up to twelve (12) months from the date of purchase (**“Subscription Period”**). Subsequent purchases of additional Consumption Units do not roll over, change or otherwise extend the Subscription Period; each purchase maintains its own Subscription Period. You can track your Consumption Units and their corresponding Subscription Periods in your AI Hub account. Units are consumed from oldest to newest. 

**6. International Customers**

International customers may purchase and use Consumption Units in accordance with this Policy. Additional local laws and regulations, however, may apply to customers located outside the United States. International customers are responsible for complying with all applicable local laws and regulations, including any tax obligations, currency conversion rules, and consumer protection requirements. 

**7. Taxes**

Unless otherwise specified, the Consumption Units pricing does not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (**“Taxes”**). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, excluding Taxes based on our net income. You agree to timely pay such Taxes as applicable. 

**8. Notice of Changes to the Policy**

Instabase reserves the right to update or modify this Policy from time to time. Any changes to the Policy will be communicated to customers through the Instabase AI Hub platform and effective upon publication except for any price increase, which will be effective thirty (30) days after notice.

**9. Governing Law**

This Policy will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflict of laws. Any legal action or proceeding arising under or related to this Policy will be brought exclusively in the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California and the parties irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
