# Prebuilt Apps

In addition to your custom apps, AI Hub includes prebuilt apps to help you process documents for common use cases, such as verifying identity with driver licenses, extracting income information from pay statements, and finding key information from a resumé.
​

Prebuilt apps also include sample documents so that you can try out these apps.
​
1. Select the app for your use case, whether it's one of AI Hubs prebuilt apps on the **Explore** tab, or one of your own custom apps from the **My Hub** tab.
1. In the app, select the samples or upload your own documents. To upload files, use the file explorer to select the files you want to upload.
1. Documents are uploaded as a batch and processed. Click the line for the batch to open your documents.
​

Results for the processed documents are visible in the panel. You can also download your results in `.csv` or `.xlsx` formats.
